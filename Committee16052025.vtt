1
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: A little loud.

2
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Let's test the audio.

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.460
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This will show up on the recording our testing of this. I'm not, you know, whatever test

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.840
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the volume this way.

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: No, that's my inbuilt.

6
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How do we care about?

7
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.519
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's it. Okay, let's try it little higher.

8
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:44.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think that's reasonable. Yeah. Okay, so networking and

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and go back. And yeah, okay, that.

10
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:59.249
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: okay. So and tez, the video looks fuzzy. For some reason, I don't know if we can like, or maybe that's just how it's supposed to work.

11
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, that's smart.

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.829
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Any matter, does it look better?

13
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.030
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Can't tell.

14
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:15.529
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think we're getting minor improvement? Okay? Yeah.

15
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:26.519
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: no, I still look so fuzzy. But you guys under a light, maybe that. Or maybe there's an ideal focal range. They're probably an ideal focal range.

16
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.519
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but it can all hear us there admit.

17
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:49.990
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Hello, you all Speaker Gallery, all right, because I don't have self view on show. A Selfie. Okay, okay.

18
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.289
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so this is more or less working. Now, Jay, is just showing a student an exam, and then has a meeting at 2. So

19
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.790
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the main thing we need to focus on. That's getting the organizational aspects set up here. Cool

20
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.890
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Fabian. If you can just put in the chat that you can see and hear us, just that. We know that the recording is going to be

21
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: not ridiculous.

22
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:42.739
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, so arguably, the 1st thing that we should do is figure out rules of order and how the committee gets established, but because so far the committee is small, and everybody who's wants to be on the committee is going to be acclaimed. I think we can push that for a later meeting. Rules of order we might want to worry about. I think again that we can push that until we, you know, have people showing up to the committee meetings. Right? So

23
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.899
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I guess, how do we do this? I move that we table the discussion of rules of order and certain organizational issues for a later time.

24
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.583
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, we'll do that for now. So the main things that we want to focus on today

25
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.389
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: write down like a some kind of agenda.

26
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Sounds good.

27
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.549
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: 1st thing I thought we should do is establish a mission statement.

28
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Make sure we're all on the same page

29
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.299
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and have some kind of focus that we can work back to. If we ever need to.

30
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Next, we should set up some kind of schedule

31
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.060
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: in particular, we'll need to discuss what kind of events we want to plan. Come the fall.

32
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.160
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and we'll add a 3rd thing. I know what these vendors are supposed to be comprehensive for other business.

33
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.180
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: As we think of things, we'll basically add to this subcategory.

34
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.490
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How does that sound? So far, this one's great. Alright. So then we'll get started on mission statement.

35
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.959
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That means just exited. So we're gonna have no idea if this recording is working which is fine.

36
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.140
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright. So I drafted one

37
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.120
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: didn't love how this ended up. I'll write it out, and we'll decide how much we want to change. So

38
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.130
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: raft of our mission statements.

39
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:27.000
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: air and support, postdocs, press, please.

40
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: or careers in math and stats.

41
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.270
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Academia, and then 3

42
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.630
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: through guest lectures.

43
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: writing workshops.

44
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.510
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: networking events

45
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:34.140
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: focused on the job, search, application and interview processes.

46
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.770
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: What I don't like about it

47
00:05:43.150 --> 00:06:01.289
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: is this middle part where I list. All the things that we're going to do guest lectures, writing workshops, and networking events. I find that very limiting. But I feel like the specificity it tells us that we're going to do something that we have a plan on how to do it. However, it then kind of limits us to only doing those 3 things

48
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:18.919
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: which worries me. Yeah, the 1st thing I would like to remove is the writing workshops not limited to just writing workshops, like writing as part of like writing proposals as part of that right, but also can writing your resumes writing other like funding application.

49
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:36.920
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This task? Right? That's just for writing. But there might be other workshops like how to make interviews like how to do multiple interviews like the host is conscious exactly. This is exactly yes. So removing writing from that will definitely strengthen this. Then we're we're very.

50
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.946
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We're very broad. Suddenly we're any kind of workshops

51
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: it. Somehow it does feel a little redundant, but it does allow us a lot of leeway. Hi, J,

52
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.869
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so this is now the entire committee.

53
00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:01.889
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We also at some point have to discuss what a quorum means for this committee. But you know again, that actually have to worry about the other things. Now.

54
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.730
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think in the line of removing writing from workshops, we've also removed guests from lectures and networking from events. And we're talking lectures, workshops, and events

55
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.370
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: quite broad.

56
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:23.909
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We're not restricted by any kind of thing. We could individually have lectures. We don't necessarily have to have guests come in, and the events that we do could be any kind of events.

57
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.329
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, cool.

58
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.650
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: alright. So I think

59
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:52.400
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that gives us a good broad mandate. We should also talk about postdocs and grad students. There is a thought that we should also open undergrads, but that might give us too broad a focus. We start having to worry about bachelor degrees, and who, you know, where is a bachelor degree in math going to be to

60
00:07:52.580 --> 00:08:04.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so are we happy at leaving it at post-docs and grad students, at least for the time being, for the following year? Okay, do we want any verbs on top of prepare and support

61
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.009
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: parent support, I think, is decently broad, but we might want other ones that further focus our mandate

62
00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:22.960
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like, one thing is like before the drop search. Maybe we want to add a little bit like the care where the how you

63
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:44.140
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: planning or strategy to plan your career, especially for those newcomers as students or 1st year. Phd, students, the yeah, they're saying, Okay, I'm already on the track. But I'm not quite clear like which way we can go for us right before we reach the job. Search part. That's a good. That's a good point. So we'll include into this

64
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.480
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: career planning forward

65
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:56.159
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and just make it a little more general than that. Yeah, yeah. Now, now, we've got pretty much everything involving careers

66
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.640
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other than really the education part, which obviously, that's not our mandate.

67
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.830
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, I like that

68
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:31.279
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other things that we want to talk about here. I was thinking, maybe postdocs and grad students in math and stats for prepare like moving 4 careers after math and stats, moving this or adding another in math, as in to prepare and support postdocs and grad students in math and stats for Career Center. You know what I mean. So it's not careers in math and stats. Yeah, okay, so we'll do this up here, right postdocs and grad students in math and stats for careers in academia and industry.

69
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.449
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That right? Yeah, okay, yeah.

70
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.200
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay.

71
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:45.499
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, then the last thing to worry about academia and industry.

72
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:56.079
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This is broad. It should cover just about everything. But there is a somebody is going to bring this up at some point. What about the public sector? Does that get included in this

73
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:11.970
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like from my perspective? It's just like a partial part of the industry. This is also my feeling. So I feel like we won't need to specifically add in a public sector version of this, there's already a public sector version.

74
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.400
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's quite challenging. I think it will be covered by industry. So we confident, then, that this is going to be broad enough.

75
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.960
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, great. Let's

76
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:38.390
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I move, then, that we adopt this mission statement in this form. Parents support postdocs and grad students in math and stats or careers in academia and industry through lectures, workshops, and events focused on the career planning job search, application and interview processes.

77
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.303
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: All right.

78
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.599
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We've got a mandate.

79
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.089
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, alright. So that covers the 1st item on the agenda.

80
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.860
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Any further discussion we want to have on that

81
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.580
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that didn't come back.

82
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:24.989
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Welcome back, baby so we finished our 1st item on the agenda drafting a mission statement. We should now talk about schedule of events. As part of this. We're probably going to need to subdivide the organizational structure of the committee down into who's going to organize what kind of events?

83
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:32.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I don't know in which order we should be doing this deciding on who's going to organize what? Or deciding on what we're going to organize?

84
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:44.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Do we have a strong opinion one way or the other? Okay, perfect. Okay? Good. Then we will start talking about

85
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the things that we should be organizing.

86
00:11:48.580 --> 00:12:04.739
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Now we've got a few time constraints on the academic side, because academic jobs. Their deadlines start in about mid October, which will give us about 6 weeks of workshop before everybody starts having to apply for stuff.

87
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:20.380
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And that's a lot of material to get through in those 1st 6 weeks. We don't want to put industry off for all 6 of those weeks, so we'll need to somehow figure out a way to do both at the same time, while also keeping in mind the timing for academic jobs.

88
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:31.160
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I thought it might be helpful to list out all the things that are generally required for academic jobs, and then we'll need to list out all of the things that are required for industry jobs.

89
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So academic job.

90
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.170
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the application generally consists of your research statement.

91
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.429
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: a teaching statement.

92
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:59.990
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: a Cv or resume depending on who you're talking to a cover letter.

93
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.289
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and from time to time Media is doing that.

94
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:17.020
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Also. Required are 3 to 4 letters of reference.

95
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.129
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I feel like I'm forgetting something. Does anybody think I'm forgetting something?

96
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think, that covers the main ones.

97
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So then there's the question of

98
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.199
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: what is required in an industry job.

99
00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:42.690
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There's also going to be a Cv, but it's gonna look drastically different from an academic Cv, you already know that?

100
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:50.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't believe research and teaching statements would get put into an industry job. Can anybody say that for certain

101
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.980
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like, that's where, like, the government structure becomes an issue? Yes.

102
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:08.999
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: right? Like, yeah, for some of the government jobs like the one you have a research team, and especially those with research associate research. Right? So this is

103
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:18.660
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: research statement. I'm gonna put the question mark there, or maybe sometimes

104
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.410
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do. An asterisk asterisk is pointed to me

105
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.199
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: sometimes, and I'm also gonna put it on the Edi statement down here

106
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.300
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: teaching statement. I don't believe this is an hour away. They can cover later

107
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.610
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: cover letter Devon. We cover letter.

108
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:54.760
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And these 2 things, I think, are going to look very similar, the cover letters in both. There's going to be a job advertisement and the cover letter should respond to that, and pretty much the same way for both of these. So this will be an easy one for us to do for both.

109
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.200
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Edi statement that might actually come up. I'm not sure.

110
00:15:00.488 --> 00:15:09.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think we might do this right sometimes. Public sector definitely, yes, definitely. But private sector gnarly.

111
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:25.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Well, I think there might be some good companies that are asking for. Well, I hope there's good companies that are asking for this in practice. Probably. Yeah, it's just the public sector which is required. They are probably making things now to the mandatory training part. Not in the application session. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so

112
00:15:26.624 --> 00:15:29.699
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but instead of a teaching statement mentoring statement.

113
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:49.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Maybe they're going to ask for. Have you mentored people? Are you aware of what goes into the process of mentoring people? I'm gonna put 3 question marks beside it, because that's how.

114
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:56.479
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then letters of reference. I assume there are also letters of reference, but I imagine it's not as high as 3 and 4.

115
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.740
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I'm going to put as a guess, 2 to 3.

116
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.230
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There's a difference.

117
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.700
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Anything else that we should be putting on. This will say, bar.

118
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:23.209
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I guess sometimes the teaching statement is grown to like a teaching portfolio. Right? Yes, it's a little bit slash

119
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: portfolio.

120
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:38.390
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think someone who's your job sneak like are asking for like projects as well project project portfolios or proposals

121
00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:42.930
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like showcases

122
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:54.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like, what have you done so far? Let's take a look at that honestly, this is very similar to sometimes like it's required in research, which is a research.

123
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.480
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Proposal.

124
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:06.540
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: this is very similar to this, you know, but it's it's different. And it's gonna look more like the project proposal

125
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.270
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: with 2 stars. Next to that, that's really it's really rare to have focal post

126
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:19.870
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: pricing like we should replace that part to like just interview. I think it's coming covered in the interview session. Right? We wouldn't want you to give a

127
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:27.249
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: a job, Doc. Exactly. Yes. So that's another thing that we should be writing down what gets expected after the

128
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.190
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Add to the whole.

129
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:37.369
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: After the whole application process. Then they took in place. We can almost. We can almost split this up here

130
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.000
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: roughly application.

131
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.529
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then down here

132
00:17:48.940 --> 00:18:01.080
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: nowadays there's a zoom, interview, campus visit, and finally a job talk

133
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.150
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: on the industry side. I imagine that there's rounds of interviews.

134
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.980
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's similar to academic vote. There's also rounds in academic

135
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:24.480
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and job talk is in the campus. Yeah. I'm only aware of 2 rounds in academics that you have the zoom interview, and then you have a campus visit

136
00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:34.350
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: as far as I understand, an industry, you can go through months of these things just they're putting you on a shelf waiting for you to become a person that they want to hire.

137
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.930
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that you're trying to figure out a way to get out of the rounds of interview.

138
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.150
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: They're mostly online.

139
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's how we should split up. We should do for online interviews.

140
00:18:54.230 --> 00:19:07.080
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: zoom interviews, which is written that twice and then also in person, introduce, and then

141
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.629
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: similar to the job talk. There may be a project presentation.

142
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't know.

143
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm gonna slash this and put elevator pitch.

144
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:34.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll want people going into industry to be able to give their pitch for why they should be hired in roughly 3 to 5 min.

145
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.199
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Not as important for academia

146
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:45.669
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that. Yeah. If you only have 3 to 5 min to get your job, you're not getting that job in the industry. That's entirely possible.

147
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.359
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, that's decently comprehensive.

148
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.000
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah. Anything else you want to add to this.

149
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:20.409
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: think we might be good on this? This might be everything that would be going into applying for a job. We're not so right now. This is the application process, the interview processes. We're not talking about job searches. We're not yet talking about career plan.

150
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:37.150
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you know, but based on time limitation, they should be the priority. These should be the priority, especially for the 1st 6 weeks, where we're trying to get these applications off as fast as possible for the round that we have coming up in the fall.

151
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:44.130
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Industry probably won't be as important, but certainly for academia. There's a very particular window that we're gonna have to hit.

152
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.510
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

153
00:20:49.020 --> 00:21:00.430
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So that we should also. So that will cover what we need to focus on for the 1st 6 weeks we can talk about the job, search and career planning at a later date. Or should we also talk about that now.

154
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:21.249
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like for academia, we should talk about that at least the job search part. Yes, career parts too late. The career? Yes, right? But like the job, search. Yeah, right on time for somebody like like when I'm in search here of my kitchen. I have no idea what math job was. Yeah. Oh, yeah, mathjob.org. We're gonna have to explain.

155
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:28.049
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I brought treats and I haven't been sharing them around. Sorry my-, my head is not going okay.

156
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:36.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I made this. Oh, sample, pass them around.

157
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:46.300
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I'm running out of space on this board. So I would think I want to move over to this other board here.

158
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's also going to be important for fall.

159
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:59.950
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then probably we'll say career planning more for spring where we actually have time to focus on it.

160
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:10.130
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But for the job search. We want to talk about websites like mattjobs.org

161
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:19.760
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and others I'm currently blanking. We'll want to talk about newsletters and mailing lists.

162
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.300
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Seems like every subsequent list, people should be a part of that's name.

163
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.519
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So it wears itself.

164
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.829
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Anybody hearing, biased or

165
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:44.749
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then networking, gonna put advisor.

166
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.220
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I'm also going through conferences.

167
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:56.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's an amorphy skill that we'll definitely want to talk about in the spring before everybody goes off to some conferences.

168
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.299
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's how you go to a conference, meet people, get a job at a conference

169
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:09.840
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that one will want to do, mock and triple score. We'll want to have mock conferences where we all go around and suddenly start talking to each other randomly.

170
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.525
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh.

171
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.020
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: should also talk about university websites.

172
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:36.750
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's harder, I think, to do those searches, but they, some universities will only advertise on their own websites. But we should mention that it's not

173
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.190
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: probably as part of that tumble.

174
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:51.970
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, the research net, like in service. So on top of that.

175
00:23:52.590 --> 00:24:01.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: doing for the job? Search? Yeah for the job, searching inside like a subclass of the websites. Yeah. Okay.

176
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.149
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so see my HR.

177
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:12.959
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And serve, what's the last one shirk? SSH, rc, yeah, yeah.

178
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: most likely will be sitting in these 2.

179
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we shouldn't completely discount for sure

180
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:32.510
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: should just put try cancel with those networks. That well.

181
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.690
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think to that point also as part of

182
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.550
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but then that's up, and oh, my gosh! Oh, that's not a good point.

183
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:56.680
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I said, not I mean not right now we should mention it. And it's a other national boards

184
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:08.360
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other countries. Everybody's got their own funding organization to run no worries. Yeah, you're gonna be an hour and a half hour.

185
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.919
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's probably helpful. Okay, yeah, when you get back.

186
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.230
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

187
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:27.459
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: What I wanted to also point out is that there's a question of amongst everything here. Does our mandate include applications

188
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: or facts.

189
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:43.690
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't believe it does, but it might be something we want to mention, because certainly applications for grants do come up on the Cv.

190
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So it might be something that we want to think about.

191
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:52.630
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm not saying that we'll put it in any of the events that we plan today, but we should keep it in mind.

192
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.030
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'll jump around

193
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.730
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: alright. I think that covers Job search anything we might be missing.

194
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:22.664
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This is the academic job. Search. That's a good point. This is academic job search

195
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.740
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: industry.

196
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.819
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There must be a canned website, different websites.

197
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.650
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: The public sector website is very particular

198
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:47.210
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: in Canada. I believe that's true of any country that we go to the public sector website that they have. There is

199
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:57.430
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: gonna be the one stop shop for public sector jobs. But of this. Indeed.

200
00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.280
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: monster, I think, operates in Canada links in here.

201
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:12.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't use it, but I hear it's big, and then, of course, specific.

202
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.840
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How many websites

203
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:22.700
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: much the same way that some universities will only advertise on their websites. Companies will also openly advertise on their websites.

204
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.549
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Probably we should also mention, and hunters

205
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: how to watch for scams.

206
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.110
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I had no idea about that

207
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:52.719
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: every time, always. It's probably a legitimate job, but I don't know how to tell you. Yes.

208
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.632
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, and also you mentioned Oscar. Plus. Yeah.

209
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:22.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: any luck with that? No, no response at all. Especially like, this is the summer. Yeah. No. I reached out to the science and career people last week of the email saying, they're on vacation until Monday. Yeah, still haven't heard anything. So we're probably.

210
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:36.229
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and the panel parts you mentioned like we don't have like a person in Qb, now representing us. Right? This is, gonna be a big thing. You have a person in Qb. Representing you, but it's for ta, so I don't know if that's too broad or not broad enough

211
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:54.699
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: for grad students to have their participation. Now, grad students do have access to. So you'll be able to talk more about that if we will. Okay, yeah, we are trying to somehow get some level of access to that. We don't. I mean.

212
00:28:55.090 --> 00:29:10.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: it's really crazy. But like it's also kind of reasonable. We're more like in the staff side, not the student side, and they have to pay a part of their tuition to those like departments. Have those services right? If you're going through the bureaucracy perspective.

213
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:18.409
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But I like we're still classified as Chinese, right? Just giving us like a draw board. I'm having that. Yeah, right? Something.

214
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.580
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Let's also hold on.

215
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.644
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Silas brought this up alumni Associations

216
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.060
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: alum, alright

217
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:41.359
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: associations apparently has a growing list of alumni. So we're gonna hopefully tap into that for some of our guests.

218
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.909
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, I'll let one more thing stopping talks, coffee tongues

219
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:56.179
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: here, yeah, about there, or beside the job. Fairs.

220
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.569
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Dog bears.

221
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Those are really nice.

222
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:10.650
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, yeah, yeah, very good, very good. Yes. They got a little rocky on the on the bike. Ride over.

223
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.610
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think they mostly stay packed.

224
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:21.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? Feel like that covers the big stuff, certainly, for the job search.

225
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.319
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But it'll be harder to tap into networks in the industry.

226
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.499
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: because our advisors are all gonna be academics and focus on the academic sector.

227
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:43.059
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We won't be able to have the same kind of word of mouth access as industry unless we really tap into the Alumni Association.

228
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.629
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and so those would probably be good people to get in sooner rather than later.

229
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.670
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Job search aspect.

230
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:57.859
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, there's already a lot of stuff that we can talk about event wise. And so

231
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.599
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: it sounds like we're agreed. But we won't do the career planning stage. And

232
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:12.529
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: until to soldier yeah, until spring, at the maybe not early. Certainly we're not gonna worry about. We won't worry about it until fall.

233
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.749
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I wouldn't even start this on that.

234
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.050
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So then we've got enough stuff here to start talking about events.

235
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:29.329
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Let me let's try and figure out what we want to start with of these things that we've now got written up

236
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:38.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: job search definitely a part that's earlier in that process. So it might make sense to start with the job search event.

237
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.099
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How are we feeling about that

238
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.639
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like we're gonna do parallels not parallel

239
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:50.260
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: at the same time. Right? You have to prepare like this. Yeah, anyway. Yes, right.

240
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.550
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that's true. Alright. So some kind of parallel event.

241
00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.590
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, how's that? Gonna pop up? Let's talk. Let's talk. Event one.

242
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.310
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Or are we still in broad scopes?

243
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.590
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Let's try coming up with an event, one

244
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:20.609
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so main focus of event, one, I have a broad overview or something specific.

245
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:34.489
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like, let's starting with, like the resume part which can be playing the role of like the impacts for everything kind of like organizing your experience. And

246
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:40.289
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: if I get an idea like what job you are going into search, what type of skills you have.

247
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:51.429
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And there's also kind of like a having a process. You have to come like the polish. Your job location goes so we can start and say, one more run right

248
00:32:52.160 --> 00:33:03.969
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: because we want to make sure that they understand. Your resume is not just the thing that tells what you've done. It's a set of goals. You want to fill out your resume with everything that you want to get done

249
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.899
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: by doing it and then putting it on the resume. So

250
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:20.549
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: all right. And that's it's the resume is great because we have academic and industry that happened them versus

251
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: industry.

252
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:29.210
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll have to separate. What an academic looks like and what an industry one looks like, and what roles are on each of those

253
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we'll need to touch briefly, then, on how to achieve each of those goals

254
00:33:51.820 --> 00:34:02.069
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: on the academic ones. Everyone's always asking grants awards. Have you shown that you can be an effective researcher. And as other people said, Yes, you can be an effective researcher.

255
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How are you going to put that onto receiving

256
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:19.590
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: always a challenge industry? Pretty much the same idea, I believe. How are you going to be an effective worker? What has so far gone into proving that you are an effective worker? How are you going to achieve those goals that you need to put on seeding?

257
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:26.969
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You know the like part of them never worrying about this is like, do we have a good enough person for the industry?

258
00:34:27.903 --> 00:34:55.339
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So we have been a guest speaker, we can definitely find a guest speaker for an academic somewhere that shouldn't too worried about that. I've already reached out to Anastasia and Bartech. Talk about something, and we'll just need to get focused on what exactly industry.

259
00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:10.700
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: My 1st thought is to use Silas's alumni list. Reach out in there and find somebody who's gotten a job with the Math and Stats degree. Have them come in and talk about how they wrote their industry. Cv.

260
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.420
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Other than that.

261
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:36.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Don't have too many ideas. I have some friends from my Master's degree who have gone on to industry positions, but their career paths seem highly particular. Maybe that's what we want to talk about. Maybe we want to have that focus of sometimes you just land. That doesn't seem helpful. Yeah, for people actively looking for industry jobs. But maybe there's some insight that we have there.

262
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:43.920
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: The 2 things. There. I'm gonna go statuses alumni

263
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:49.989
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: list. I put Silas along my list. We obviously like a more official alumni list. But apparently this doesn't exist

264
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:58.009
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: which is bizarre. It's possible that we might have to do some more taking to find it more official than other ones personal contacts.

265
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.960
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'll reach out to my personal contacts and see

266
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: who wants to talk about this of.

267
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.379
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Now that brings up an interesting question.

268
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:17.189
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This is going to. If this is going to be done in parallel. We're essentially going to have 2 guest speakers in the same workshop

269
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:30.790
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: talking about almost 2 different things, and then it's possible we'll then be asking them back next the week after to talk about something else related to the job. Are we comfortable with that? Or you want to have

270
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.460
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: this individualized structure for each of them.

271
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:38.279
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't love an individualized thing because it means 2 people in the room less discussion.

272
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:46.269
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We're not talking about similarities. We're only talking about differences. So I like the idea of having a split down before we can talk about both.

273
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:55.370
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But that is going to put some constraints on who's going to come and talk, and how often they'll be able to talk. Got you

274
00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.100
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: what we might do now we're talking more about format than we are talking about content.

275
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.960
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: or in the book I'll put down the format fit. Here.

276
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.890
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We might find it record presentations

277
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:19.919
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: of the industry people and play those before. So that might be more feasible. Yeah, like a podcast format.

278
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:36.589
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: free board issues, we have the attendees, submit questions ahead of time that we'll ask the people record those.

279
00:37:37.020 --> 00:38:00.579
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We can bank those presentations then, and use them in kind of this dual format that we do both. At the same time the academic people not not to treat them as just free all the time, but we can just ask them to come down almost whenever I feel like. If they want to do pre recorded as well, we'll obviously offer them the option. But I'm expecting that we can do the in person

280
00:38:03.086 --> 00:38:09.880
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so also in person presentations.

281
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:30.310
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: One of the things that I would really like us to do is Q&A's where we have these speakers. Respond to questions, specific questions from the attendees, and also for us to prepare some insightful questions about the process. Because we've been through the process. We know some of the hurdles from the middle of the specific things that we want to work on.

282
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.080
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm also going to include in person one actually for both.

283
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.409
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You end of day, session time.

284
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.479
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and in particular, for this 1st event.

285
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.759
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: what we want is a writing workshop

286
00:38:52.310 --> 00:39:00.450
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: where we workshop ideas on the resumes where everybody compares these things. Now that's going to.

287
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think I don't think the camera can pick it up. But just in case yes,

288
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:22.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the issue is going to be that we're going to start off with presentations and a Q&A, and immediately go into the writing workshop. Nobody's going to really have time to learn things from here and then use it there.

289
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:40.239
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So there's a thought here that we split this into 2 parts over the same week, or separate weeks, where we have the presentations. And then we come back later to show what we've learned and how we've improved our Cvs. How are we feeling about that? Do we actually feel that we can do

290
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.880
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that? Many workshops that's gonna double us some time during the time.

291
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.209
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think of it.

292
00:39:47.440 --> 00:40:13.300
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I'm a little bit hesitating about the workshops here like that is the frequency of like this type of workshop. Because the question is like, now we're covering post office and graduate students. We all have a supervisor who will be actually the best person to actually helping us on the resume, or at least the review of the resume. Right. So it's not like really necessary to have like a workshop, especially for the female side. Right?

293
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:38.370
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Right? This is true. Yes, industry, though industry, though. But the problem is like, I don't think like the industry. People have the time to do that thing. I probably don't, and that was great. And also I'm not sure for us. For post office students. They have the order services out there, and they have like one on one sessions. So I think the idea would be better to just list off

294
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:56.149
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: those resources and give some templates. That would be better way. I do love a good template. Yes, okay. So we're going to cross off the writing workshops, then the workshop, at least for the 1st event. What we might want them to do is after a number of weeks when we talk about all these things that need to be written.

295
00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:04.779
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We then have a workshop that is dedicated just to everybody, bringing in examples of the parts that they're worried about, and then we can rehash those.

296
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.939
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So this would be then an event.

297
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:18.870
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm going to pencil it in as event Number 6 a writing workshop.

298
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.939
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I guess we could possibly leverage some of the previously existing like library stuff that would do this

299
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:43.310
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: writing workshop. Yeah, because I think they run like nondescript writing. I mean, it's possible that someone involved in that wants to. You know, that would be amazing if we get more help on. Yeah, I think at this stage we're looking for as much of it wants to.

300
00:41:43.310 --> 00:42:04.730
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We can definitely reach out to the library and ask how they do their writing workshops, and also casually mention, hey, do you want to run one for us? There are. There's a number of organizations within the university that are all somehow in and around doing something like this at some point in time. For various reasons, we want to obviously be hyper focused on our mandate now.

301
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.770
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So it's a question of who we ask. Student success Center would also

302
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:18.379
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: love this, but more for undergrads. Probably right. The library are the people to talk to first.st

303
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, we'll have to figure out a schedule before we contact them to make sure that we can.

304
00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.430
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you know, get them on a on a proper basis. Okay.

305
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:54.256
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: yeah. For the industrial side. The thing is like, we're talking math and stats. This seems sounds to be really special. Right? Require some level of practice. I try, like, like my career services departments is not really helpful. Right? So I'm thinking, like what kind of like department level resources we can have right? Especially, we have a finance mathematic programs. And

306
00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:10.750
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we're we had. Yeah. But we're might no longer have them anymore. But we still might have the resources out there.

307
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.990
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We can ask what he's got on this. He must. I?

308
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:31.929
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm really hoping, related to my industrial jobs based on my emails with Bartech.

309
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:50.979
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't think you're all Ccp. Based on the way they've been rolled out. There is the same lack of resources of any kind within the department we got CC'd a bunch of people who are all tangentially related to careers.

310
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.909
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and it's not clear

311
00:43:54.330 --> 00:44:19.489
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that any one person is in charge of that so part of our mandate may end up being as part of our support mandate is, would be to establish some of these resources on the faculty level. So that's why we're going to keep talking to Bartech. Right? Also, I think, like the like for inviting some guest speakers from industry. Right? Yeah, like using the departments titles definitely, much, much better than we ask personally, that's true.

312
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.599
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Someone like David for the financial contract or something. Okay.

313
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:37.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: He used to be the head of the finance firm before, but he was the one with all the contacts. He's retired. But I I don't know. He's still around.

314
00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:58.539
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, we can. We'll definitely have to talk to him. But we'll need those contacts. But you are. I think you are absolutely right. We what we want more than anything, for the department is the letterhead. Yeah, we want that signature box saying, this is official official, and what we might want to do is get a faculty advisor on the committee who is able to send out those kind of emails on our behalf.

315
00:44:59.223 --> 00:45:04.459
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We can also just sound very professional. I think ourselves just put in the

316
00:45:05.021 --> 00:45:12.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: there. Yeah, like, the thing we're syncing is like, there's a difference

317
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:37.079
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: in the industrial job like the I think for some of this stuff right in wanting an Hr person is more efficient than wanting one of our alumni like, if we're only constrating ourselves to our personal contacts. The best chance we can get is alumni right like that's helpful at some level. But I think the Hr.

318
00:45:37.080 --> 00:46:02.049
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: More we'll definitely need an Hr person for the interview process, or Hr. Or like Pr. Related person. It's a department title for the big help it's going to be. It's going to be huge. They're not going to respond. So that's that's a very good point. I guess the other thing just reiterating Silas's previous remark. I guess steering the

319
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:08.499
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: industry contacts. It's like it's, you know, it's easier to find.

320
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:20.159
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you know, a path to industry for people that kind of do, applied math. But maybe also trying to highlight that like getting the paths for people that do more pure things. This is this is a great point.

321
00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:29.610
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I haven't put an organizational structure in here. I'm just gonna put notes on the side here.

322
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.513
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll need

323
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:50.410
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: David's contact list or industry department letterhead or invites

324
00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: need to think about industry and pure.

325
00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:10.850
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and I guess if David is the contact on the finance side, then I would assume that Anna so would be the contact on the insurance side of things.

326
00:47:12.608 --> 00:47:22.779
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: He seems to be the insurance person it is, and and as far as contact lists, pretty interesting.

327
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:27.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So the notes or sorry no like honest Abdallah. Oh.

328
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.460
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: yeah, I don't think those have to.

329
00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:33.379
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: He might might.

330
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:39.399
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we definitely have some material science tab. That's true. That's very true

331
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:58.280
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: inside our department. And I badly, definitely gonna have some resources related to insurance. Right? Yeah, I mean, one of the people in my personal context, got into insurance. Oh, it's definitely it's definitely a big thing. But so far that has been almost entirely applied. Mathematics pure math.

332
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:06.290
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's gonna be a hard one, right? Yeah. Where? I mean, we'll figure outers.

333
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:21.515
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, I don't. I don't think it's for us to figure out how pure math is in the industry job to figure out how to use. I don't. The one with the one company with connection to Mcmaster is

334
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:28.837
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Omnium is like a the data driven

335
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:40.630
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: consumer packaged goods. What do you call this consulting company? And there are 2 pure math grads from Waterloo, and they do have connects with Matt.

336
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:43.660
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Specifically, Greg has worked with him before

337
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.110
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'll describe that omnium. OMNI,

338
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:56.670
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, think that's gonna be logistics.

339
00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.830
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah.

340
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:13.399
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Logistics to me. Makes a lot of use of grass, and I would have also thought topology a lot of pure mathematicians. Exactly. We don't want to send them all to Amazon warehouses.

341
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.950
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But that's definitely a good place to start. Yeah.

342
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: a really good place to start.

343
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:31.419
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? So we- we do have some kind of a plan. Maybe we can reach out to Omni and Eric are in here. Talk about pure math and industry, how we?

344
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.080
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

345
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So then, event, one

346
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:52.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: sounds like we're getting close to figuring this out. What a 30 min presentation from an academic speaker talking about questions. Go on your Cv. Probably, Bartech, because he's on the hiring side of things.

347
00:49:52.320 --> 00:50:04.230
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then in industry, we'll need to reach out to maybe an Hr. Person, maybe one of our contacts or alumni saying, What's on your CD. What's on your industry? CD, point of view that grad school

348
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.450
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and we might have that be a pre-recorded presentation

349
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.275
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that gives us 30 min for each.

350
00:50:11.204 --> 00:50:19.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There'll be some Q&A. Either in the Pre. Recorded, and also then at the in person that'll comprise the hour.

351
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.539
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and this will give them some information about how to start writing a Cv.

352
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.009
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then we'll also include them at the end of that

353
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: handles

354
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:44.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: both of our speakers right and even like super accessible. If it could be like some over leaf template, that's really good.

355
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:52.212
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We might have to do that ourselves. Yeah, yeah, my volunteers tributeful.

356
00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:04.388
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Can you just check to make sure that there's nobody trying to get? Yeah, you think there'd be some kind of notification? Let's see

357
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:10.352
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: just be at the top. I can't see at the top that there is any notification.

358
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.390
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright, I think, that covered our 1st event. Then we know what this is. Gonna look like

359
00:51:18.322 --> 00:51:22.820
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we should. Then I mean, how many of these things you want to plan?

360
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.999
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Let's let's try planning out

361
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:35.460
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: 1st 6 of you. We already know that 6 is going to be a writing workshop or one of these numbers. Do we want to copy this format event? Number one or the next

362
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.270
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: fine

363
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:47.450
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: covering, different kind of statements that will lead. I think it has a really nice symmetry, and then also, if the industry people are super busy, we could possibly

364
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:57.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you. You know this. This could be some asynchronous, you know, set of tasks for them to record these videos at some point, and then we could paste them out, you know.

365
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.440
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yes, exactly.

366
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:16.099
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That would be. I think that'd be very helpful. Because we're not. We're not stressing too much on. We might try and set up the same kind of interview for each of the industry people, and then somehow collect the relevant portions for each of the workshops that we have. Yeah, I mean, we could even like try to just zoom call them for some

367
00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:21.420
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: 2 h period and just chop it up. And you know, I think that's a great idea. Yeah.

368
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:39.749
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like, since we have this nice stuff, and we can have about this size of classroom running remotely or in the hybrid mode right like I don't. This not not necessary to have those industrial person in person.

369
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:45.229
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: not as unique industry. I know everybody likes to give an in person talk rather than online talk.

370
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:55.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You know, we we're limited by the universe. I think I think that would be a good compromise for everybody to get pretty important stuff, you know.

371
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Be a good compromise on time and advocacy.

372
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:13.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright. So then, we know sort of the format. Then, for the 1st 5 or so, and then we'll finish off that section with the writing workshop. So it's a question called, What order do we do these in?

373
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.460
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Obviously we have to start with the application process. So we know number one.

374
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:24.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: See views after that. What are we looking at?

375
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:31.467
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I think the second one is should be some job search stuff.

376
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.050
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

377
00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:50.780
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Right? Like, if they don't have a part job like the power adder. Yes, that's very true. No, yeah. Now you've thought about your skill set. Let's now match it up, Job. You can actually take on

378
00:53:51.680 --> 00:54:01.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like to this part. We can be trying to do some part ourselves, and maybe add some other resources right? At least opinion side. We know.

379
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:10.720
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think, good enough stuff. So this format, then, will be more of a a land or workshop that we lead as a committee.

380
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:15.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: maybe let roachel

381
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: where we go over all of these things together as a group

382
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:51.200
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the industry people, we might have again, with the pre recorded presentations. Just ask how you got your job, what what means? And then I'm not sure how this is possible. But if we're having the department title, we can ask some Linkedin, or indeed, guys. And I think we have, like a certain amount of interest

383
00:54:51.300 --> 00:55:02.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: to doing this task? You think so? I mean, these are highly intelligent people looking for jobs, indeed, monster, how are these people not going to leave office, especially Linkedin, just trying to get everywhere

384
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:08.770
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: for volunteer options. Now they have to have a Linkedin thing. The department sends nothing around. Every day.

385
00:55:10.622 --> 00:55:22.110
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We need to find the correct person. Indeed, monster.

386
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:26.060
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: etc. I don't even think anybody uses monster anymore, but

387
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:32.330
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: used to it when I was improved. Spokesperson.

388
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:52.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But again, that might be a pre recorded, or if they are really eager, they might find in person talk us through their website. Basically, the other thing with the job search is. I don't exactly know how this is constructed at fields, but they have these like various

389
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.279
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: kind of like

390
00:55:54.950 --> 00:56:19.179
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: career, focused things like, you know how they have their like cyber security program. And they have these. So I don't know. Maybe someone from Fields to talk about their kind of career in there several times. And the point is like they have those systems out there. But they're also struggling to what we're struggling. Okay, okay? So maybe they're not the best. Yeah, that's kind of sad. Okay.

391
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:42.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: like that. They then we have more resources than we do. They can invite, like industrial speakers by a lot, and like those from the former companies like I'm in House and myself, the problems of they are inviting at the manager level and like the

392
00:56:43.190 --> 00:57:02.670
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: talk really nicely to us, but they never have like details suggested to us. And they all saying, we're really looking to, to working with mathematically and statistical guys. But all the job posting on their websites is to us from their website.

393
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:11.390
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That sounds we're so eager to have you with us. We're not going to tell you how you become part of us, but we're so happy that you're trying. Yeah.

394
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:17.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, my God, I mean, that's just that's just a suck part for me, plus yeah.

395
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.829
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That made me think of something, and then I immediately forgot it, and I can't remember what it was. I'm sorry.

396
00:57:26.562 --> 00:57:37.470
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I guess the other thing, too, is I was talking to one of Anastasi's grad students, and he was saying that he was frustrated with the fact that

397
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.960
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There's no like you can't access the Co-OP opportunities. A grad student.

398
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:47.849
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So so maybe I don't know if there's some way to.

399
00:57:48.040 --> 00:58:05.200
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I mean, obviously, they're not going to allow grad students to do co-OP, but like maybe some way to access that network that Mcmaster already maintains, somehow, like expanding, not calling it a co-OP. But this is a network that Mcmaster has. They already have it so why can't the tap into that?

400
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:08.420
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'm gonna put that down here?

401
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:18.539
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, the Co-OP call. Yeah.

402
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:24.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: right? I think that has something to do with that stuff right?

403
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:32.231
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I think they also post those like from a question poster call opportunities to also help us.

404
00:58:32.820 --> 00:59:01.767
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think that's the idea. Well, I think that is the idea. In practice. We don't know if that's actually happening. One of the things that we should do in part of the research aspect of this workshop is finding out. If that's true, if that's true. Yes, I I think we haven't really talked about the research side of this workshop. We're going to want to get a bunch of numbers, you know, on who's getting jobs. How are they getting jobs? Percentage of the department that goes on to actually get work in the field, particularly

405
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:08.789
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: these are numbers that the university should have, but also based on my conversation inside of us, they don't have. Yeah.

406
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:13.549
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So part of, I think our task would be to put those numbers. Yeah.

407
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:24.709
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I think that will then be part of this is finding out how exactly coal and Oscar plus connects to one another. Yeah, and how we can use that to our advantage. Yeah, that's a very good point.

408
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:48.459
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Basically, the other thing for the job search is a lot of times, you know on math jobs. They say, like, you know, we're open to any research area that aligns with our department's interest. Yeah. So maybe some some spreadsheet, just, you know, taking the like, whatever 12 main interests of our department, and just going through all at least Canadian schools and saying like, is there a tenured faculty member that does this type of research at this school. I don't just love that.

409
00:59:48.520 --> 01:00:00.780
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's great, not really natural set, or but I'm gonna put it there. Spreadsheets on department interests.

410
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.820
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I'm going to specify new 15th

411
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:16.750
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: U. 15 is a good organization that we can start with, because it's Canadian. Most of the people are going to be applying for them. They're the best schools in the country when it comes to research.

412
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:26.010
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And so we'll definitely have post information from them, and we'll be very representative of where people are. So that would be a good list to start with.

413
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.819
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: After that we would probably want to start looking at r. 1. Schools in the United States. That's gonna be a whole.

414
01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:41.239
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I mean, No. r. 1. Schools are the same. No pair of r 1. Schools behaves at the same way. So that's gonna be that's gonna be a challenge

415
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:44.239
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: starting with you for Gmail. Much more manageable.

416
01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:57.919
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That does mean that our second event job search is going to be quite long and unwieldy. Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of stuff that we're gonna try and cover in fashion.

417
01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.369
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think it's good to try and cover all of that.

418
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:08.510
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we do have to keep in mind that we're gonna have to make it tight. So we'll have to. We'll have to have more meetings. Then about how we're gonna organize that.

419
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:16.600
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There's gonna yeah. There's gonna be some research aspects of it as well that we'll have to try and get through. Most of that's going to be talking to people

420
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.750
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: at Oscar Plus University, unfortunately, over this arm.

421
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we are going to have to struggle through that. Yeah.

422
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:33.869
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I believe that's going to be number 2, number 3. We go back to the writing.

423
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:43.130
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, back to the application, I'm thinking. Number 3, cover letter.

424
01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:46.469
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Once you found the job you write, the

425
01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: this is arguably the hardest one, you know.

426
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.480
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: because it's the most subjective. What might be a good idea to have that be next.

427
01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.670
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: though I think most of the questions are gonna come about these 2

428
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:07.399
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: or academic jobs. Yeah, unfortunately, there's not someone industry that's comparable.

429
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:25.849
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But like, we don't need to be like, we smashed on both sides. Especially, we have like a time limitation for a demon job, we can focus on more on demand job nice. We already have the even number one and 2 in parallel structure. Yeah, and we can focus on a little more on keeping the job. That's very true. That's very true.

430
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:29.099
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Colorado. First, st like the 3rd one.

431
01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:35.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think, like in the universities, level like at the female level, the providers are almost like have the same structure.

432
01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the dresser Trast.

433
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:52.599
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Those positions? Yes, right? So. The only thing that makes me hesitate on this is that in the cover letter you are supposed to give an executive summary of all of the other material you're sending out. And so

434
01:02:53.320 --> 01:03:03.420
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: you almost want to talk about the cover letter, even though the most important thing you almost want to talk about it last? Yeah, just challenge, because we don't. I don't think we should leave it to last, but also

435
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:23.029
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: essentially as part of this part of the workshop, then is going to be, and this is where you put the executive summary of your, but also it might be easier for them to write executive summaries of their research and teaching statements in the cover letter and then figure out what the research teaching should be. Think of dynamic, you know. Have them all looped together.

436
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.450
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, so I've convinced myself again. Number 3, cover letter. I agree. Okay, they are.

437
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:38.220
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We're progressing with the schedule of events. We're up to the 3rd one.

438
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.890
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How much of this do you want to get filled in?

439
01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:53.720
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, so the format we've got so far for events, one and 3 is to have 30 min for academic 30 min for industry.

440
01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:17.089
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Generally speaking, there's going to be a guest speaker for each of those for the industry ones we're looking at pre recording their presentations and getting actually a bunch of industry speakers into a single block, all talking about cover letters. Well, for the 1st one resumes and Cvs for the 3rd one cover letters and then for the academic side. We'll just have somebody come down

441
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:25.860
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: again not to treat them like they're just cattle, but I expect we can get somebody to come down and talk about. Yeah, cover letters.

442
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:41.180
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: For the second event, we're going to be looking at job searches, and that's going to be more of a a workshop. We're going to sit down and do a bunch of searches and talk about the different things that go into the searches. I don't. Yeah, we

443
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:47.830
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we can get industry people to come down from, indeed, or monster or Linkedin and talk about job searches there. That'll be handy.

444
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.290
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we should plan on doing that ourselves.

445
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.875
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

446
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.160
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So then that brings us to Event Number 4,

447
01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.509
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we're keeping on with the application

448
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:04.879
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we've got on the academic side research teaching and edi statements

449
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:08.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: on the industry side, we basically have

450
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.550
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: any other statement that we want to put in an industry portfolio that gets sent out.

451
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:24.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: The question is, now we're getting into hyper specifics for industry and academia. Do we continue to do this in a hybrid format, or do we split them up into one academic one industry?

452
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:35.749
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think we can do the speech especially. We're having a time limitation for obtaining, so they might want to 1st have the research and teaching statements as a combination and

453
01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.890
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: 4, and then we don't want all of these together

454
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:50.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: into the portfolio. We'll have some kind of portfolio session when we talk about portfolio.

455
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There are 3 common letter, one Cv.

456
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.039
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then portfolio.

457
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:09.910
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's gonna lump in every other statement that industry requires. So we'll put together.

458
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:15.140
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: which is most is gonna look more like a portfolio, I would say, and it's going to look like a bunch of statements.

459
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:22.699
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but for that one we'll need somebody to come in and say one way or the other what that is supposed to look like, yeah. So that'll again be

460
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.180
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: our recorded

461
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:35.149
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: our pre recorded presentations will ask everybody, what did your portfolio look like? Did you need a portfolio. Did you not need a portfolio? This will depend really on who we're talking to on that list.

462
01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.759
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So these might be a lot of pre-recorded talks

463
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.520
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that we do over zoom over the summer, so

464
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.909
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we won't worry too much about the task that we need to get these done

465
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:53.690
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: yet, but I think we should, we will need to at the end of this meeting, come up with a list of tasks

466
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.889
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that we'll need to split up amongst ourselves.

467
01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:07.330
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then from there fighting workshop. Absolutely. Yeah. Happy to have some other input on this.

468
01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:23.250
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So it looks like we've got our 1st 6 events. If we are keeping the writing workshop as Number 6. The thing that we haven't talked about that is very important for the application process is letters reference. Do we talk about letters of reference in its own workshop.

469
01:07:24.372 --> 01:07:31.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Think we're talking about an hour for each of them?

470
01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.330
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, I don't think you need an hour. I don't know what we would talk about, you know.

471
01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:45.819
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And I think at some point it's probably where at least graduate students, right? Supervisors plus committee members that's concentrated for. Yeah.

472
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.819
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't know. There were definitely 2 members on my committee that I did not feel comfortable asking for letters.

473
01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.829
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You like the externals. Right?

474
01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:57.529
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You don't put people.

475
01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.929
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, but like the Ta supervisors.

476
01:08:02.609 --> 01:08:13.149
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, ta, supervisor, okay. For like the teaching, yes. So when there are 4, and sometimes when there are 3, I think that's in.

477
01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:26.670
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah. So there's there's stuff to talk about, right? Like, should you request at some point during your ta or lecturing, that you have some. You definitely.

478
01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:42.089
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't know if you've done this yet. When you are an instructor as a postdoc, you have somebody come by and look at you informally, with the intention that they will then write a letter of reference for you. This has not

479
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:52.159
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: happened right in most cases, right. The person doing this has done it in such an informal way that any letter it's written it's incompetable. So

480
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.299
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think our department does have a formal process for requesting this. Now, is that true?

481
01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:02.829
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There is not a formal process for requesting this. Now, okay, what you can do, what I did.

482
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:20.870
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and this was not, I guess the norm. I asked Mcpherson to come in and look at. Look at my teaching. Okay, and do a course refinement. And then, based off of that I asked for a teaching reference from the Mcpherson Institute representative, who looked at all of that with me.

483
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:28.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That, I think, is a better pathway forward, because it's more rigid, it's more structured.

484
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:48.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I it was not the norm, though, because Mcpherson Institute Guide did not, had not done that before for anyone else. So I think what we might want to do is if we put that forward as an option for the Teaching Reference letters in the workshop to talk to Mcpherson Institute about having this be a path that this is something that they could do like that.

485
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:54.760
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Because I think I think honestly, it's the only way we're gonna get teaching reference letters. I don't think

486
01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:02.585
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I I think it's gonna be tough to get professors in the department doing that. I think that would be ideal

487
01:10:04.123 --> 01:10:17.019
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but it still leaves us with the question of Where do we put letters of reference? Because obviously we do have like a 15 min, spiel that we could should maybe talk about for letters of reference for honestly, both academic academia and industry.

488
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But it's not gonna come up. Cover a whole hour.

489
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.119
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Where can finance together with Cdi statements?

490
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.000
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, so I was thinking of putting it in with edi statements and with research and teaching students.

491
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:36.090
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: My things get to split it because this this will take a while.

492
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:40.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So combining these, maybe that could be 5.

493
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:52.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Well, probably that is the industry version of 4, 6. Yeah, so this will do. Then 6. Then we'll put 7.

494
01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:53.699
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Take it back here. Its face

495
01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:00.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that the that gives us our 1st half of the fall semester. Yeah, okay.

496
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.419
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that's good. Seems like a good plan.

497
01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:12.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: honestly, this we don't probably don't have to worry about until late in the fall when people actually start getting offers for Internet.

498
01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:18.720
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So we can probably put a PIN in that, for now we've already done well over an hour. Now

499
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.020
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: for this 1st meeting, so

500
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:29.620
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: probably start to wrap it up. But we now need to start talking about, though, is how we're going to establish how we're going to do this now that we decide what we're going to do? How are we going to do?

501
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:58.849
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Or maybe one question, yes, for the number 2. Yes, I guess this is more for grad students. But like, I guess, the big question before the job search is understanding, like the academic culture, and that like, you know. You take the post up at the r. 1, or you take the, you know, full Professor job in the middle of nowhere. And how does that affect your future? You know, like, because I guess, like this is more so like you want you want some job abstractly, the future. And then these these jobs are kind of.

502
01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:09.450
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: we wanna ask them, is which jobs to prioritize

503
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:20.675
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: both stuff versus wrong as an example.

504
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:34.439
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Now, that's a great question and it turns out that it varies moment to moment, right? And so somebody told me at some point that they had gotten a professorship. It was a professorship.

505
01:12:34.650 --> 01:13:04.540
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Obviously they had to go and take it, and then they got offered the most amazing postdoc position that they had to take. And so there was this complicated mix of well, you said, yes, this professorship. Now you don't want it. What the hell's going on here? It was like. No, it was a very prestigious postdoc position, so there are some postdoc positions that will override professorships, but I think those are few and far between, and so we'll want to stress that for that. I think we'll want to have somebody come in and speak to that as part of the academic job search.

506
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.860
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And there's also like teaching oriented. That's true. Yeah.

507
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:17.020
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: teaching versus research.

508
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:25.341
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Honestly, the way they describe teaching professorships here. I don't think they've figured out teaching professorships. Yeah.

509
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:30.080
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I don't know that we want to be advising people from teaching professorships given.

510
01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:33.469
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Given the weird workflow that they're currently under

511
01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.210
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that being said, a job's a job.

512
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:45.330
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: There will be also good to have somebody talk with regards to that, probably barsec again. I don't know. He's not really into the chat service side of things.

513
01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright, does that cover everything that we want to talk about for these 1st 7 events?

514
01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:57.709
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, okay, I bring a lot of stuff here

515
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: just gonna have to take pictures because I'm not writing it down yet.

516
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.279
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so now we need to decide

517
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:08.529
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: who's going to do what and how we're going to do this, what needs to get done?

518
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:14.480
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Why are you trying to fit this thing

519
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:18.620
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: alright cool.

520
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.760
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll see.

521
01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.939
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll need to contact speakers

522
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.230
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and part of that record the meeting.

523
01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.589
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll try and write that better.

524
01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:46.270
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Good.

525
01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:54.590
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That'll probably be the biggest time suck of all of these things, finding people who will speak and reporting their speaking

526
01:14:56.250 --> 01:15:02.149
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: separately, getting academics to sign on.

527
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:09.380
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That should be easier. That should just be us calling up our supervisors and asking them to come down for a sec

528
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:15.889
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and for bars that gig getting some of the department side people who are in charge of hiring down

529
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:20.049
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other things that we need to think about.

530
01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.880
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll want templates for all of the right.

531
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll want templates for a research segment teaching segment. Cv. Cover letter. The I statement.

532
01:15:36.963 --> 01:15:43.490
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: drive, yeah.

533
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.620
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Well, please.

534
01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:58.840
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: or a onedrive which is attached to the university. Oh, that's true. We are a 1. We are a Microsoft school. Yeah.

535
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:05.866
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: unfortunate it is. It is unfortunate. So we'll- we'll use one of these.

536
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:13.199
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I yeah, I gotta say, I hate how onedrive works. But at least we all definitely have a onedrive attached to the university.

537
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.850
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's what we can do.

538
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:22.059
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that we can then also share with other people in the university to put things up. So this might be the one to go with

539
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.809
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Other things that we need to think about.

540
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:30.119
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll need to do some research.

541
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:34.118
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, but like, okay.

542
01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:38.970
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: got it.

543
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.129
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's awesome

544
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:54.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: research, wise, basically. Just, you know everything that's going on in all of the events.

545
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.850
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Mostly the job search, though.

546
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.260
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: doing somebody switched over to our subscription.

547
01:17:05.698 --> 01:17:13.920
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We'll need to advertise around. So on that note, we'll need a website.

548
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.810
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, we'll need a website for the workshop.

549
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:48.150
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Like. I think we can just treat this whole thing as like a department, so we can save some effort on that. I would hope so. I would hope so. Now the thing that they tell me I don't know how much specifically, is that the Department has very little control over its own website. I think that is true and can't really update things as on a week to week basis. You know, I don't know. I think that 4 centers that's happening.

550
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:58.949
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Sorry for Sanders now. Okay, so I think then we will talk with Emily about establishing a website

551
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:02.970
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then updating the website regularly with all of the events

552
01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:13.809
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other advertising things that we should think about mailing list. But I talked to Emily about this already, and she says, just forward it to her.

553
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.490
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You know best.

554
01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:26.420
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: apparently, that should still go through Madeline. I'm not convinced by that, but that's what she says.

555
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Beautiful

556
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: other things

557
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:49.180
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: scheduling we can't do anything about until we have everybody's actual schedules down the professors currently have theirs or tentative ones. None of the postdocs have any of theirs

558
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:54.040
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and grad students. I'm assuming ta positions don't get posted to like ours.

559
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.459
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: if not somehow. 1st week of September. Oh, Jesus, okay.

560
01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:25.739
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But we'll definitely have to have a schedule before the 1st week of September, so we'll deal with that does, I guess, raise the question of when we would like to be having this. I'm guessing an evening is better. Probably 5 30 might be more manageable than something earlier. I think so, because then we don't have to worry so much about courses going on. The issue is then, of course, 6, 30. We'll obviously have food whether cater or

561
01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:32.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: on that note. Siam student chapter apparently can help us with catering. Well, I think it's going to be the cookies again and the coffee.

562
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:57.969
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't think we should be too excited about the catering, so the question is like, Do we have like funding for this? We apparently can get a little bit. Lays was CC'd on my last email with Bartek, and he is in charge of the student chapter. This I am student chapters, apparently reorganizing, and as part of that, apparently we might fall under its catering services, so we might get something on that end.

563
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:16.389
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: The other question is, if one of the big industry people want to sponsor, I don't know. Is that a thing that you do like. I think that's too much effort. Well, as part of our research into the job search and and getting people, we might just mention it to somebody. Hey?

564
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.369
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Do you have money for us? No, just like, you know. Bring it up.

565
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:26.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: oh, so like on that note.

566
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:34.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, it might help on that note. Sounds like there were people that we should be contacting.

567
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.059
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I can't remember if I talked to everybody.

568
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.889
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Oh, I did get verified. Okay, shoot.

569
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:49.969
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: A lot of people weren't helpful. We didn't respond. If there's other people around the university that we want to be talking to that, we can figure that out, probably over the summer.

570
01:20:50.320 --> 01:21:00.470
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So on our in more general context, not necessarily contact speakers, but general content.

571
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.870
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So that's going to be all part that's going to be Qp.

572
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:34.120
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the call, Mcbain, I don't think, is going to be able to help us on this. They're focused more on leadership training, and I don't think there are people we want to talk to about this. I talked to Emily about this, and she said she's had no contact with them which really suggests they're not going to be a helpful bunch. I don't know any mathematicians who are currently part of their program, otherwise I would ask them, Is this worth our time?

573
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.289
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So think I don't think that's gonna be affected.

574
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.979
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Other general context that we should be thinking about.

575
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: We want to talk about now reaching out to Opart and Qp.

576
01:21:50.770 --> 01:22:09.490
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: yeah, I can mention that in a bit. So I haven't done that yet, because I want to have a general discussion before we do that. So now concerning part is for post office, like we don't have access to surface. Even the job board is not open for us. I try different ways, different login mass

577
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:23.380
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: masses using my map master credential and none of them work and already send out to like emails to the career services, who should be responsible for this platforms and no response were.

578
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.909
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: now, it's about 10 work days.

579
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:36.119
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, right? So I'm thinking, races to Qe or part level.

580
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:48.830
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So we can have some discussion about, like if we can actually gather access, or if there's some way we can bypass the limitation we have.

581
01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:54.400
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I mean, it's a very arbitrary limitation.

582
01:22:54.890 --> 01:23:07.259
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I don't see any reason why they don't want postdocs getting jobs through. Oscar plus doesn't make sense. I mean, they might come back and tell us no. In fact, this is very intentional, because postdocs, let's have them actually say.

583
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:16.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, I think it's safe to 1st outreach to old part first, st

584
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:44.250
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: because, like this is still not escalating to content. Now, if we wish to keep you, we don't know how that goes to the like the universe itself, and we will raise this up to par 1st and see how to react.

585
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:54.803
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That's a good. That's a good idea. I would want Opar, I think, in on this sooner rather than later. So yeah. So I'll mention, like the where, like organizing a gender workshop or like

586
01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:12.900
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: the events for searching for like assets, test students and post office part of that. And we're trying to like, get access to those purpose and see what to get us. Okay, perfect

587
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:41.270
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so that's going to take care of Opart. Then Qp. Will wait on. I believe there are still stewards. I just think there's no lead steward, but I don't know how that works. I don't know how Qp. Works. So for any postdocs who happen to be watching this definitely. Go to the next. Gmm, where we'll be electing a lead steward for postdocs.

588
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:47.320
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I know this probably means that one of us is gonna get roped into doing that so

589
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:49.519
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: but still show up and go home.

590
01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:58.760
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, does that cover everything that we need to get done before September.

591
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:09.319
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: If we do forget something, we can always email each other. We've got the email chain going. We can email each other about

592
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:16.780
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: what needs to get done. But I think this covers the main aspects of what needs to get done.

593
01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:21.630
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? So then, it's a question of who's doing what

594
01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:37.139
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: it sounds like we're all contacting various speakers. I have my personal number. That I'm going to reach out to style is going to give me his alumni list. I will start reaching out through that. We need to find Hr people somehow. This I'm not so sure about.

595
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:45.879
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah, I can working on that. But I think we should talk with Spark up first.st Got it like the part of the type hold. Yes, yes. Okay. Yes.

596
01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:55.849
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Department letterhead back with the advisor.

597
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:00.340
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay.

598
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:15.209
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so that's going to be step one. Then I will follow up with Bartek then, and I'll CC you. Then on the new email, so that we're all we're all in on that conversation about getting a faculty advisor and department official department letterhead for the workshop.

599
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:18.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then from there we can start reaching out beyond that.

600
01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:26.959
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So that's really gonna be step one. Then for next week, when we start contacting speakers.

601
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.369
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Every does. Everybody have speakers that they think that they can reach out to? Or

602
01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:50.050
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: how do we want to do with do with that? I don't think there's a too many speakers problem. I think if we ask a bunch of people, and they all say, yes, we're just gonna have a lot of pre-recorded interviews, a lot of things that we cut together.

603
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:56.650
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I think we can all just reach out to as many people as we can think of in industry and academia, about getting stuff done

604
01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:03.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that feel good, interesting templates.

605
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:13.249
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I have some from when we ran a very tiny version, 3 version version of this last semester. It's very light.

606
01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.570
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and honestly, they're bad templates, but they got people hired.

607
01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:25.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So we'll continue using those, because obviously they were effective. But we should try and find something a bit better. There's a few websites we can lean back on.

608
01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: so I think people should keep an eye out for templates on.

609
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:35.470
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: If the note there, we'll start up a okay, let's decide. Google drive or onedrive. How are we feeling

610
01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.809
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: who feels very strongly about using onedrive?

611
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.430
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? Who feels very strongly about using Google drive.

612
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:58.350
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? If there is. Okay, let's go with onedrive. We use onedrive because it is technically official department stuff. We can share everything a bit more easily on that.

613
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:06.779
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Once I figure out how sharepoint works, we might be able to use that. But I do believe it's that's different than one drive. It's different. Okay, it's essentially.

614
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:15.560
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: it's not meaningfully different, but somehow different and slightly easier to share things. But it's also post docs aren't allowed to use it.

615
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:23.679
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I would have to get special access, so it might not be worth us going through that when I'll look into it. Okay.

616
01:28:24.442 --> 01:28:38.349
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and then I think we shouldn't have everybody do research into all the things that we're talking about. So we should establish. Who is going to do research on. Let's start with the job search. We have a number of things there on the job search.

617
01:28:39.067 --> 01:28:43.910
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: You want to do that. Yeah, perfect. Okay. Great.

618
01:28:44.795 --> 01:29:01.199
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: What else was there, we should try and compile a list of websites that we should be looking at. Not so much university websites, but things like mathjobs.org, like the Tri Council, like Nsf

619
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:04.630
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: that we can lean back on.

620
01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.029
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Who's got the time to go through websites.

621
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:28.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? Great newsletters and mailing lists. These are harder. I think we might want to talk around the department and see who's on what mailing list. So that'll probably be part of our contact speakers is finding out what mailing lists are.

622
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:30.729
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And so that will also then be word of.

623
01:29:32.412 --> 01:29:49.169
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, for the industry side of things Yasko Plus is ongoing Alumni Association. We should try and find out what details we can get from the Alumni Association with regards to career advancement. How that's going.

624
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:57.110
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Somebody out there has to have a list of job fairs. So this should mostly just be a matter of reaching out to the relevant organizations at the university.

625
01:29:57.890 --> 01:30:03.790
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Anybody can take care of that. Yeah, I'll do that part engineering doing those complex stuff sort of perfect.

626
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.885
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay?

627
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:10.940
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And the websites, Jay, can I ask you to also take care of those websites. Yeah, correct.

628
01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.120
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay.

629
01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:16.690
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And then advertising.

630
01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:22.879
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I will reach out to Emily about the website. Since I've already talked to her about the mailing list.

631
01:30:23.316 --> 01:30:39.470
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I've made websites for like little Mcmaster things before, so I could do that unless there's some easy way to just put it on. Well, my hope is that it's just going to be looking like one of the other seminar webs. That'd be very right. Because that should be.

632
01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:51.027
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: It's very official. It looks very official. If Emily is going to tell us. No, we're not allowed to have a website anywhere attached to this, I have a server. It's got enough space to hold to host a website

633
01:30:51.930 --> 01:31:14.809
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So I don't know about a separate website, but certainly within my domain. And so we could, we could host it on. Yeah, I think, like, the summer summer side is not that hard? It's just kind of weekly update. What we're gonna have for next week's workshops. Exactly. That should be straightforward. The website is just kind of like a summary, like what we have and where to find all the resources should be not that hard.

634
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:39.749
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: This is why I think we would want the sharepoint, because I think, Sharepoint, you can share that information publicly, but in the onedrive folder you can only share with people you've shared like. Have you ever considered teams like a teams channel? Oh, I hate teams. I know why you hate it works for industrial people, but also like, it's a good way to share all the things and keep that. Okay, yeah, I get annoyed by the notification.

635
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:55.309
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: But certainly, if it's effective, we will. Let's use it. You know, we should have multiple means. And it's also have like building connections to onedrive. This is true. Yeah, that's true. So it should. It should be much easier than to get those things up. So then we'll start up a teams as well.

636
01:31:55.907 --> 01:32:03.059
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'll probably throw that into the email when I ask Emily about the website, right? And then the general context.

637
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:17.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I'll I'll keep thinking of who we're supposed to talk to about that. But I think the main, the main ones I've already sent out the 1st emails to. I think the one we're missing is the library the library should have stats and whatnot, but

638
01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:25.339
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: maybe they don't parsec will also help me figure out exactly who should do what?

639
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:34.840
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: who to contact. So in the email, to him about the letterhead and the faculty advisor, we will also bring up.

640
01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:37.060
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Who else should we be talking to at this stage?

641
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:39.279
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think that covers everything.

642
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright.

643
01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:50.130
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think, then, that's going to wrap up our agenda. We still have 3 other business. Is there other business that we would like to discuss?

644
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:53.710
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Is there business in 2 that we didn't get to?

645
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:56.249
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: And does anybody want to revisit one again.

646
01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:06.250
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Alright! I think that's good, then. Doesn't sound like we've got other business. Sounds like we're satisfied with the mission statement and schedule of events.

647
01:33:06.783 --> 01:33:12.789
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Don't know when we'll be able to meet again. Don't know if we'll need to until we've got more things set up.

648
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:27.440
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I think like the good idea is like we call like, set up a schedule for our meeting in a regular basis. So pushing everyone to working on that right? Okay, great. So like, are we

649
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:35.540
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: 2 or 3 weeks? Okay, 2 or 3 weeks? Yeah, that should work same time.

650
01:33:36.630 --> 01:34:01.709
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Yeah. Okay. Friday, 1, 30, probably 3 weeks is going to be a bit more manageable for people over the summer, and we're also going to have to have a hybrid options, I think, because conferences are coming up. I know I'll be away at several points in time. We should also establish a forum. Then how many people can we have at one time to establish an agenda and events that we

651
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:05.500
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and items on the agenda and get things agreed upon.

652
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.400
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: I would say, since we're 4, 3, it's 50 plus one.

653
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:14.240
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: So if there's 3 of us that can meet, they meet.

654
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:16.860
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Figure this out and go from there.

655
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:28.370
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: That sound good. Okay, next meeting, we should probably figure out stricter rules of order and all of this stuff. So it's something we'll want to start thinking about.

656
01:34:28.944 --> 01:34:33.780
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Because if this does take off, then you know, we'll need some kind of structure going forward.

657
01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:41.070
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: How does that sound? So? Then, 1st order of business on the next agenda is going to be rules of order.

658
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:45.103
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay? I move that we adjourn the meeting.

659
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.490
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: Okay, didn't get direct

660
01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:53.550
mccoidc@mcmaster.ca: and.
